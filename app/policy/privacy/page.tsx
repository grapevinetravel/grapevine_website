            HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR?

            We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes
            we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
            reporting requirements. We generally retain your data for 6 years or less.
          </p>

          <p className="text-body mb-6">
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount,
            nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from
            unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process
            your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and
            the applicable legal requirements.
